DH Box is a cloud computing platform for the digital humanities. _A_ DH Box is a single cloud computing workstation. This just means it's a computer that lives in the Internet, rather than on your laptop. Everything you can do on a DH Box you can also do on your own computer. But if you used your own computer, it might take a while to set up all the software just right. DH Box already has all the software you need, and it's all configured correctly. This allows you to get right to work, without spending hours installing and configuring software.


## Working with Files

You can get files in and out of a DH Box in a number of ways. Let's start by using the file manager. Download a plain text file (a file with the .txt) from the Internet.
