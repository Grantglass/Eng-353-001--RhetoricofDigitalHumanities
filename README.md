## Getting Started with Humanities Data

[U.S. Gun Deaths](https://guns.periscopic.com/?year=2013) -U.S. Gun Deaths

My first exposure to this visualization was when a professor showed it to me as an example of something he would like to do with his research. This is a common occurrence, and a valid way to begin working on a Humanities data project. I am often approached to do a project that begins with examples like this or involves a researcher who has collected data but who is not sure what to do with it. Based on those encounters, we know how hard getting started on one of these projects can be if working with structured data is new or foreign to you and the role of technology in this kind of work is unclear



## Behind the Viz

![](image1.jpg)


1) Structure:
	gun death by name, age, gender, location, date

2) Analyze:
	gun deaths by age

3) Communicate 
	compare actual age of death to what could have 	been age of death if not for gun violence

## Translation

```
Is: taking information that is informal and unstructured and making it fit into a rigidly formal and structured medium.

Goal: Make it possible for a computer to read your sources.

Birmingham police officer's father killed in shooting, 2 in custody

Birmingham police are investigating a homicide that happened Monday morning in the southwest part of the city. Police say a man was shot at 209 3rd Avenue SW near Zion Star Missionary Baptist Church around 9 a.m.

Police identify the victim as Birl Jackson, 76. Jackson was the father of a Birmingham police officer and had been a deacon at Mt. Calvary Baptist Church in West End for almost 40 years, according to members of his church. Jackson had been making a living cutting grass and maintaining lawns for decades. He was on the job with two of his grandsons when he was shot near his truck Monday morning.

A neighbor says he heard several gunshots and came outside to see the victim slumped over his truck. Jackson was rushed to UAB Hospital where he was pronounced dead. 

Birmingham police think robbery may have been a motive in the shooting.

Father, baby son shot dead in Oakland 
By Henry K. Lee, Justin Berton and Kurtis Alexander 
Updated 11:20 pm, Wednesday, August 7, 2013

An 8-year-old girl at a sleepover. A pet sitter driving through her neighborhood. And now, a father and his 1-year-old son, in Oakland for a slain relative's funeral and sleeping in a bedroom filled with children.

The latest horror to visit a city already reeling from gun violence happened early Wednesday, when someone opened fire through the window of an East Oakland home where 17 members of an extended family were staying. When the shooting stopped, 20-year-old Andrew Thomas lay dying near his 1-year-old son, Drew Jackson. The boy, mortally wounded, died before sunrise at a hospital.

Unlike the July 17 killing of young Alaysha Carradine and the fatal shooting a week later of Judy Salamon in her car, police think someone set out to kill Thomas. But even longtime investigators were shocked that someone would fire indiscriminately into a bedroom where four children were sleeping.

"It's absolutely unacceptable that we have children being shot while they sleep in their bed," said interim Police Chief Sean Whent. "It is horrific."

## What Does Your Data Look Like?

![](image3.jpg)


```
Our new-formed data leaves us with some issues that computer is going to have trouble with. If we asked the computer to show us the times when gun violence occurs, could it? What if we ask the computer to show us where these events happened on a map? What other kinds of arguments could we make with this data?
```

## Stage Two: Analysis

Analysis = finding patterns and/or outliers in your data + making an argument about them

As we can see from the gun violence examples, analysis often starts as we begin shaping our data

Analysis is nothing new to a humanist: we are are just swapping out flash cards and sticky notes for spreads and databases


## 2 Steps in Translation

```
1) standardization - process of deciding upon one way of representing a piece of information that appears in the source in a number of different ways

2) classification - process of grouping together information (‘strings’) according to some theoretical, empirical or entirely arbitrary scheme
```

## Examining Steps of Translation


![](image4.jpg)


[Unique Words](http://poly-graph.co/vocabulary.html) - Unique Words


1) Structure:
Rappers by name, lyric count, region, wutang affiliation – could have been (album sales, # of albums, producers worked with)

2) Analyze:
	rappers by unique lyrics

3) Communicate 
	compare lyric uniqueness by rapper, region, and affiliation to wutang



## Identify Standardization And Classification ?

![](image5.jpg)

Here is the data behind the rapper lyric visualization. Can you identify the occurrences of standardization and classification?










![](image6.jpg)





Red = Standardization
Orange = Classification

The id is standardized for the computers sake. Computers don’t like spaces and will do weird things with ordering when capital letters are present. What’s important is the researcher separated the id the computer will use to identify each artist from the column that will be used to display the name. This way the researcher optimizes the computer’s retrieval of this data while also making it human readable in the visualization.

Classification here is also used to help the computer optimize retrieval and presentation of the information. Here we use classification to help us make some key comparisons in our data, namely how is lyric uniqueness is effected region and just how lyrically talented the wutang clan was.
